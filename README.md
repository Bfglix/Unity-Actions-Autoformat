# Unity Actions Autoformat ðŸ”Ž

This action can be used to auto format the scripts in your Unity project! Making it easier to work with others with different formatting.

This action is built on top of the work of others, so a big thank you to `andstor/file-existence-action@v1.0.1`, `andstor/file-existence-action@v1.0.1`, and @shiena for the gist to build off of!

Here's the original gist â†’ https://gist.github.com/shiena/197f949bc513858a85883d5529730310
